# buildR-engine

A no-code game engine, it would use events sheet method to build games

The game engine would make use of PlayCanvas API

it's currently been built with ReactJS

### Note

I would write a better documentation after my Exams :P

# For Development

At the moment the app only has a really good looking UI, no game can be built with it yet. You can create a PR to Improve it :)
